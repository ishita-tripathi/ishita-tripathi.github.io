In this paper, we explore whether women adopt an inefficient research strategy relative to men, that contributes to this phenomenon. We use a dataset comprising around 6000 research articles, published between October 2020 to March 2021 in 104 peer-reviewed economics journals, spanning ten research sub-fields within economics. Controlling for the quality of research article, Sarsons et al (2020) found that same paper may add different credit to a woman&amp;rsquo;s tenure depending on the gender composition of the team of coauthors. Given this bias, our associational results show that women are inefficiently producing 72% of their research in the two least rewarding publication types - coauthored with men and women in equal proportion or coauthored as women in minority proportion. The corresponding statistics for men is 20%. These statistics are consistent, with some variation, across research sub-fields and journal rankings. We present back-of-the-envelope calculations about the increase in women&amp;rsquo;s likelihood of tenure if they adopted men&amp;rsquo;s research strategy. We also discuss the supply-side and demand-side factors behind women&amp;rsquo;s observed research strategy.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
