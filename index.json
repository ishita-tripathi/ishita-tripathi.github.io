The non-immediate effects of terrorist attacks on trust in institutions, however, remain largely unexplored. Arguing that maintaining law and order and upholding peace is considered the responsibility of the political and legal institutions in democracies, we theorize the “accountability effect” suggesting that terrorist activities indicate institutional failures in preventing casualties, undermining residents’ trust in these institutions. Using over 350,000 individual-level observations from the European Social Survey, we find evidence of the accountability effect showing that exposure to terrorist activities undermines self-reported trust in various national and international institutions, including the parliament, legal institutions, the police, politicians, political parties, the European Parliament, and the United Nations. Whereas this negative relationship does not weaken with additional terrorist attacks, strong governance and high trust in institutions mitigate these adverse effects. Lastly, terrorist attacks do not affect trust among people.\n","date":1728e6,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1728e6,"objectID":"c969b3e3dd794364a89cedcd518aa196","permalink":"https://ishita-tripathi.github.io/project/trust/","publishdate":"2024-10-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/trust/","section":"project","summary":"Chandan Kumar Jha, __Ishita Tripathi__, *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, 2024.","tags":["Terrorism","Trust"],"title":"Terrorist Attacks and Trust in Institutions: Micro Evidence From Europe","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" A growing strand of literature documents how historical agricultural and ecological factors continue to determine women’s role and well-being in society through cultural transmission even today. Studies have shown that such factors are significantly associated with perceptions regarding women’s right to jobs and their abilities as political leaders. However, scant attention has been paid to women’s ability as business executives and their democratic rights. Using individual level observations from multiple waves of the World Values Survey, this paper investigates whether these historical and ecological factors can explain perceptions regarding women’s democratic rights and their ability as business executives. Overall, our findings support the existing literature and show that historical agricultural and ecological factors (ancestral plough use, Neolithic transition, and ancestral resource endowments) have a much broader impact on women’s rights and abilities in diverse contexts including the labor force, business, and politics. Given the robustness of this phenomenon, it calls for broad affirmative action favoring women in different social spheres.\n","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"d1c2359215279359783423127c0b5bcf","permalink":"https://ishita-tripathi.github.io/project/ier23/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ier23/","section":"project","summary":"Chandan Kumar Jha, Sudipta Sarangi, and __Ishita Tripathi__, *Indian Economic Review*, 2023.","tags":["Gender","Attitude","Historical factors"],"title":"Do Historical Agro-Ecological Factors Agro-Ecological Factors Shape Attitudes Towards Women’s Rights and Abilities?","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Anti-immigrant sentiments are rising across the globe, influencing electoral results, economic policies, labour market outcomes, and even businesses. The factors influencing such sentiments range from socio-economic to cultural. In this paper, I study the impact of one such random shock – terrorism, on anti-immigrant attitudes. I utilise the variation in time and location of terrorist attacks to identify their effect. For this, I analyse the opinions of more than 250,000 individuals belonging to 32 European countries over the period 2002 to 2019. I find that there is around 4 percent decrease on average in an individual’s pro-immigrant attitudes after foreigners have carried out terrorist attacks in their country. But this detrimental effect disappears after 6 months and is more localised. My findings imply that inspite of being a relatively rare experience, exposure to terrorism can briefly prejudice an individual against immigrants, but only when the perpetrator(s) is of a different nationality. This can be helpful in understanding the factors leading to increased animosity against migrants.\n","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664582400,"objectID":"af1a1d5035dc21a82379078ccd5d6035","permalink":"https://ishita-tripathi.github.io/project/antiimmigrant/","publishdate":"2022-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/antiimmigrant/","section":"project","summary":"__Ishita Tripathi__, *Economic Modelling*, 2022.","tags":["Terrorism","Attitude","Immigrants"],"title":"Are terrorists responsible for anti-immigrant sentiments?

The selected studies, identified through a systematic search using terms such as “AI,” “employment,” “labor/labour”, and “wages,” display considerable variability in metrics and methodologies. To standardize these differences, we calculate partial correlation coefficients (PCCs) and apply the Funnel-Asymmetry Precision-Effect Test (FAT-PET) to detect publication bias. Neither linear nor non-linear tests reveal evidence of publication bias or a significant impact of AI on labor market outcomes. Robustness checks using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Weighted-Average Least Squares (WALS) highlight the critical role of study characteristics—such as AI adoption measures, econometric methods, and publication attributes—in shaping results. Overall, the findings do not support pessimistic conclusions about the negative impact of AI on labor market outcomes.\n","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"f64b5f103f5cbeb7acf3e228ce571d2c","permalink":"https://ishita-tripathi.github.io/project/metaanalysis/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/metaanalysis/","section":"project","summary":"Emanuela Carbonara, Enrico Santarelli, __Ishita Tripathi__.","tags":["Meta-analysis","AI"],"title":"Assessing the impact of AI on the labor market: A meta-analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Students often exert low levels of effort on the test, especially in low-stake tests which may paint an incorrect image of their true learning levels. Offering pecuniary and non-pecuniary incentives may be effective in increasing such effort but often not feasible. Increasing the maximum points assigned to the test may be a supposedly irrelevant factor that can frame it as more valued, and nudge students to exert more effort on the test. Using a natural field experiment, we randomly assign 1235 students to a test framed as either carrying maximum 20-points or 100-points, and study its impact in both high-stake (comprising non-risky and one risky question) and low-stake (comprising only non-risky questions) test settings. While we find a small and statistically insignificant average treatment effect in both settings, we find positive treatment effects (1) among lower ability students in a low-stake test, (2) among higher ability students in a high-stake test only when the question carries the risk of a negative penalty. We discuss increased mental effort as the mechanism driving these effects.\nWorking paper available on request\n","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"93b45d87a6f89363cb4600f48f1eb321","permalink":"https://ishita-tripathi.github.io/project/saliency/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/saliency/","section":"project","summary":"Puneet Arora, __Ishita Tripathi__, Arihant Jain","tags":["Education"],"title":"Maximum Points and Effort on the Test - Evidence from a Natural Field Experiment","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Left-wing extremism (LWE) and related conflict between insurgents and Government troops have claimed several lives and hampered inclusive development in the last five decades in some eastern, central and southern states in India.
