Studies have shown that such factors are significantly associated with perceptions regarding women’s right to jobs and their abilities as political leaders. However, scant attention has been paid to women’s ability as business executives and their democratic rights. Using individual level observations from multiple waves of the World Values Survey, this paper investigates whether these historical and ecological factors can explain perceptions regarding women’s democratic rights and their ability as business executives. Overall, our findings support the existing literature and show that historical agricultural and ecological factors (ancestral plough use, Neolithic transition, and ancestral resource endowments) have a much broader impact on women’s rights and abilities in diverse contexts including the labor force, business, and politics. Given the robustness of this phenomenon, it calls for broad affirmative action favoring women in different social spheres.\n","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"d1c2359215279359783423127c0b5bcf","permalink":"https://ishita-tripathi.github.io/project/ier23/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ier23/","section":"project","summary":"Chandan Kumar Jha, Sudipta Sarangi, and __Ishita Tripathi__, *Indian Economic Review*, 2023.","tags":["Gender","Attitude","Historical factors"],"title":"Do Historical Agro-Ecological Factors Agro-Ecological Factors Shape Attitudes Towards Women’s Rights and Abilities?","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Anti-immigrant sentiments are rising across the globe, influencing electoral results, economic policies, labour market outcomes, and even businesses. The factors influencing such sentiments range from socio-economic to cultural. In this paper, I study the impact of one such random shock – terrorism, on anti-immigrant attitudes. I utilise the variation in time and location of terrorist attacks to identify their effect. For this, I analyse the opinions of more than 250,000 individuals belonging to 32 European countries over the period 2002 to 2019. I find that there is around 4 percent decrease on average in an individual’s pro-immigrant attitudes after foreigners have carried out terrorist attacks in their country. But this detrimental effect disappears after 6 months and is more localised. My findings imply that inspite of being a relatively rare experience, exposure to terrorism can briefly prejudice an individual against immigrants, but only when the perpetrator(s) is of a different nationality. This can be helpful in understanding the factors leading to increased animosity against migrants.\n","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664582400,"objectID":"af1a1d5035dc21a82379078ccd5d6035","permalink":"https://ishita-tripathi.github.io/project/antiimmigrant/","publishdate":"2022-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/antiimmigrant/","section":"project","summary":"__Ishita Tripathi__, *Economic Modelling*, 2022.","tags":["Terrorism","Attitude","Immigrants"],"title":"Are terrorists responsible for anti-immigrant sentiments?

Offering pecuniary and non-pecuniary incentives may be effective in increasing such effort but often not feasible. Increasing the maximum points assigned to the test may be a supposedly irrelevant factor that can frame it as more valued, and nudge students to exert more effort on the test. Using a natural field experiment, we randomly assign 1235 students to a test framed as either carrying maximum 20-points or 100-points, and study its impact in both high-stake (comprising non-risky and one risky question) and low-stake (comprising only non-risky questions) test settings. While we find a small and statistically insignificant average treatment effect in both settings, we find positive treatment effects (1) among lower ability students in a low-stake test, (2) among higher ability students in a high-stake test only when the question carries the risk of a negative penalty. We discuss increased mental effort as the mechanism driving these effects.\nWorking paper available on request\n","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"93b45d87a6f89363cb4600f48f1eb321","permalink":"https://ishita-tripathi.github.io/project/saliency/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/saliency/","section":"project","summary":"Puneet Arora, __Ishita Tripathi__, Arihant Jain","tags":["Education"],"title":"Maximum Points and Effort on the Test - Evidence from a Natural Field Experiment","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this project, I examine how exposure to violent environment, like one created in the aftermath of terrorist incidents, alters an individual’s trust in the effectiveness of institutions, such as the country’s parliament, the legal system, the police, the politicians, the political parties, the European Parliament, and the United Nations. We employ the variation in time and location of a series of terrorist attacks that occurred in between 2001 and 2017 in different European countries to study their effect on people’s trust. Our results reveal that when an individual is exposed to terrorist attacks that result in human fatality or injury, his/her level of trust in institutions decreases significantly. Also, the effect of exposure to terrorism-related violence wears away with time. We find evidence of spillover effects - an individual’s faith in establishments is negatively influenced by his/her nearby neighboring countries’ terrorism.\n","date":1619481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619481600,"objectID":"c969b3e3dd794364a89cedcd518aa196","permalink":"https://ishita-tripathi.github.io/project/trust/","publishdate":"2021-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/trust/","section":"project","summary":"__Ishita Tripathi__","tags":["Terrorism","Trust"],"title":"Impact of terrorism on trust in institutions","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"``Leaky pipeline\u0026#34; phenomenon is often used to describe the decreasing presence of women at subsequent stages of academia in economics. In this paper, we explore whether women adopt an inefficient research strategy relative to men, that contributes to this phenomenon. We use a dataset comprising around 6000 research articles, published between October 2020 to March 2021 in 104 peer-reviewed economics journals, spanning ten research sub-fields within economics. Controlling for the quality of research article, Sarsons et al (2020) found that same paper may add different credit to a woman’s tenure depending on the gender composition of the team of coauthors. Given this bias, our associational results show that women are inefficiently producing 72% of their research in the two least rewarding publication types - coauthored with men and women in equal proportion or coauthored as women in minority proportion. The corresponding statistics for men is 20%. These statistics are consistent, with some variation, across research sub-fields and journal rankings. We present back-of-the-envelope calculations about the increase in women’s likelihood of tenure if they adopted men’s research strategy. We also discuss the supply-side and demand-side factors behind women’s observed research strategy.\n","date":1587945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587945600,"objectID":"22a2d214529e163f44eaa0dcad8090ae","permalink":"https://ishita-tripathi.github.io/project/genderbias/","publishdate":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/genderbias/","section":"project","summary":"Puneet Arora, __Ishita Tripathi__, Khushi Trivedi","tags":["Gender","Academia"],"title":"Women playing by inefficient rules - Evidence from academia","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"81d05257eed13d0ba1611a58fded6e52","permalink":"https://ishita-tripathi.github.io/project/lgbt/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/lgbt/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"project"}]
